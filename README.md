# Weather Api App

## Introduction

This is a webpage where you can check the current weather in any city in the UK.
I created it using HTML, Sass (+ Materialize framework), and JavaScript, using a webpack setup.

## How to use

The website is pretty straightforward.

Type in the city name and either click the submit button or press enter.

Toggle allows you to close the dropdown menu if you like!
